        <p>The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (commonly called the Coachella Festival or simply Coachella) is an annual music and arts festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, in the Coachella Valley in the Colorado Desert. It
            was co-founded by Paul Tollett and Rick Van Santen in 1999, and is organized by Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of AEG Presents.[1] The event features musical artists from many genres of music, including rock, pop, indie, hip hop and electronic
            dance music, as well as art installations and sculptures. Across the grounds, several stages continuously host live music.The festival 's origins trace back to a 1993 concert that Pearl Jam performed at the Empire Polo Club while boycotting
            venues controlled by Ticketmaster. The show validated the site's viability for hosting large events, leading to the inaugural Coachella Festival being held over the course of two days in October 1999.

        <p>Coachella returned on an annual basis beginning in April 2001 as a single-day event. In 2002, the festival reverted to a two-day format. Coachella was expanded to a third day in 2007 and eventually a second weekend in 2012; it is now held on consecutive
            three-day weekends in April, with the same lineup each weekend. Organizers began permitting spectators to camp on the grounds in 2003, one of several expansions and additions in the festival 's history. The festival had not been held in 2020
            and 2021 due to travel restrictions and ban of public gatherings in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <p> Coachella showcases popular and established musical artists as well as emerging artists and reunited groups. It is one of the largest, most famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and the world.[3][4] Each Coachella staged
            from 2013 to 2015 set new records for festival attendance and gross revenues. The 2017 festival was attended by 250,000 people and grossed $114.6 million. Coachella 's success led to Goldenvoice establishing additional music festivals at the
            site, including the annual Stagecoach country music festival beginning in 2007, the Big 4 thrash metal festival in 2011, and the classic rock-oriented Desert Trip in 2016.
